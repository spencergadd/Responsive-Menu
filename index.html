		<h1>Travelog</h1>
		<p>
			We left from SLC and flew to Guadalajara, MX. It was an open airport with misquitos everywhere.
			After a 6 hour layover, we flew to Mexico City, where we stayed the night. The next morning we flew 
			to Lima. It was a beautiful city right on the ocean. The beach was black rock. We did some day excursions
			from Lima for two days and then we flew to Cusco. After a day acclimating to Cusco's altitude, 
			we left on the Inca trail. We hiked for 4 days until we reached Machu Picchu. It was beautiful. 
			After we rode the train back to Cusco, we went to get our Covid-19 tests so we could fly home the 
			next day, but we tested postive! We had to find a private room at our hostel and stick it out until
			we tested negative.
		</p>
		<h2>The Food</h2>
		<p>
			Peru is proud of their national dish--the guinea pig! I wasn't brave enough to try it, but it probably
			tasted like chicken. They did have lots of good food. Our hike was actually catered by a local
			guide company and they fed us an unbelievable amount of food!
		</p>

		<h3>Ruins</h3>
		<p>
			All along the hike there were ruins left by the Inca. The trail itself was an amalgamation of stones
			built by the Inca 500 years ago. Working on the trail was a form of taxation. We also saw ruins outside
			of Cusco, and on our day excursions from Lima.

					<h2>Article 1</h2>
					<p>
						Hiking is a common form of exercise. It's a great way
						to get in shape, increase heart health, and clean out your lungs,
						although medical consesus hasn't been reached regarding that last point.
						You can hike for many reasons. This is so cheesy...
					</p>

					<p>
						This past summer my wife and I travelled to Peru and spent 5 days hiking to 
						Maccu Picchu in the Andes. It was a magnificent trip, although we got Covid-19 
						in Peru and getting home was much more difficult than we anticipated.

					<h2>Article 2</h2>
					<p>
						There are ample places to hike in Utah. We are blessed with immediate access to 
						alpine terrain. But for my wife and I, we also like to travel and see new places.
						Because of this we have hiked in Nepal, Italy, and all around the Western United States.
					</p>

					<p>
						We hiked along the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, along the Meditteranean
						coast in Cinque Terre, Italy, through Yellowstone, the Sawtooths, and the
						Windrivers in Wyoming (and Idaho), and we tried to hike Mount Shasta, but
						it was too hot. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the exercise aspect of hiking, we also like to include painting, rock climbing,
						and yoga on our hikes.

			<h3>Aside Information</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the hikes we do are local. We try to hike every Saturday in the Spring/Fall,
				once a month in the Winter, and whenever we can in the Summer, if it's not blazing hot.
